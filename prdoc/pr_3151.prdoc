title: Dynamic deposit based on number of proposals 

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      Introduce a dynamic proposal deposit mechanism influenced by the total number of active proposals, with the option to set the deposit to none.

      This is achieved through the introduction of the `GetDeposit` trait, and the corresponding implementation should be supplied to the pallet's configuration. The pallet provides basic implementations for this trait.
      Two new calls are introduced:
      - kill(origin, proposal_hash): the cancellation of a proposal, accompanied by the slashing of the associated deposit.
      - release_proposal_deposit(origin, proposal_hash): the release of the deposit for a non-active proposal.
      Additionally, benchmarks have been upgraded to benchmarks::v2.
