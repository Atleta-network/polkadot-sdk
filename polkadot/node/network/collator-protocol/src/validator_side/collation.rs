//! Primitives for tracking collations-related data.
//!
//! Usually a path of collations is as follows:
//!    1. First, collation must be advertised by collator.
//!    2. If the advertisement was accepted, it's queued for fetch (per relay parent).
//!    3. Once it's requested, the collation is said to be Pending.
//!    4. Pending collation becomes Fetched once received, we send it to backing for validation.
//!    5. If it turns to be invalid or async backing allows seconding another candidate, carry on
//!       with the next advertisement, otherwise we're done with this relay parent.
//!
